            Multiple nodes can all connect to a Service Bus topic, each one will create its own subscription and then they can all communicate with other nodes using Broadcast messages (pub-sub).
            Examples: When new nodes start in a blue-green deployment they can notify all other nodes and old nodes can check if they should still be up or if they should get inactive

            Using Service Bus Queues (with Message Duplication detection enabled) we can use the Queue as a simple scheduler.
            In a multinode cluster all nodes can define the same scheduled jobs, they will all enqueue the execution of jobs as a scheduled message 
            which will only be delivered when it's time for the job to run,
            and only one node will get the message and trigger the job.
