            <summary>
            Allows multiple nodes to communicate with each other through broadcast messages using a Service Bus Topic (each node will create it's own Subscription).
            Through broadcast messages (and callbacks registered for each possible message) the nodes can communicate and orchestrate their actions. Some examples:
            - In a Blue/Green deployment when nodes from the new deployment start up they can notify all other nodes so that old nodes can verify that they should become inactive.
            - When we scale up or scale down (add new nodes or remove nodes) all active nodes can recalculate some partitioning function to distribute their loads
            - Periodially nodes can send a heartbeat so that other nodes can trigger an alert if we run short of active nodes

        <member name="T:AzureServiceBusUtils.AzureServiceBusScheduler`1">
            <summary>
            Allows multiple nodes to be all scheduling recurring jobs and relying on Service Bus Queues to trigger the job at the right time and to enforce that only one of the nodes will be running the job.
            The Queue must have Message Duplication detection enabled.
